Hidden Hot Springs


This app is a conglomeration of user added hotspring locations. It is intended to be a place where people can find hotspring locations that may not be able to be found in more widespread publications.  Users are encouraged to add locations of hotsprings that they know about, that other users may be interested in checking out. 


To run this app:

Clone the Repo<br>

Run rake db:seed to start with some initial content<br>
Run 'shotgun'<br>
